                <p>Worked on the second year group project to develop and deploy a Centralized Blood Bank Management System for Hospitals and Blood Banks in Sri Lanka. Worked closely with the project supervisors by adjusting functionalities and the user experience of the application. Was able to get familiar with project management tools(Trello) and Git Version Controlling.

                    We propose a web-based application so that customers can have access to an online tailor shop and have their needs satisfied even without stepping out of their comfort zone; home
                    and the tailors can promote their textile products online. This project aims to automate the manually maintained tailoring sector. We are trying to help people to make their lives easier
                    by providing online tailor-made clothes shopping.

                    I was able to implement a simple traditional weather app using Open weather API. By using this application users can see the current weather data for given location in the world.

                    they are playing games. The main purpose of the project is to help parents of kids.

                    I have implemented a chat application called “Jithson chat”.

                    I have implemented a research project called “JSON RPC Library & Client-Server framework from Ballerina” as my internship project 
                    at WSO2.  Mr. Nadeeshaan Gunasingha who is a former tech lead at WSO2  was the mentor of that particular project. 
                    I was able to get a lot of experiences (technical and non-technical) by doing this project. After completing the project we pushed 
                    our project into the Ballerina Central. 

                    Activities of my internship project
                    <br><br>
                    ◼ Did research on the project and created a system specification.<br>
                    ◼ Did the implementation of the project and testing.<br>
                    ◼ Added use cases for the implemented project.<br>
                    ◼ Created nice documentation for the project.<br>
                    ◼ Did a code review and pushed to the Ballerina central.<br>
